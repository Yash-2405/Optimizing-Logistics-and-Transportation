# Problem Statement
Logistics companies often face challenges in managing routes, inventory, and manpower, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. Our goal is to develop a system that optimizes these aspects in real-time, reducing fuel consumption, delivery times, and overall costs.

# Hybrid Optimization Approach

Our solution integrates multiple algorithms to address the various aspects of logistics optimization:

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: For the shortest path calculation.

Genetic Algorithm: For multi-variable optimization.

Random Forest: For predictive traffic and weather analysis.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data generated from a python module faker, including Lattitudes, Longitudes, Sources and Destination. This data is then preprocessed for use in the optimization models.

# Solution

The system is built using Python, with key libraries including Pandas and Scikit-Learn. The following tools and platforms were used:

Google Maps API: For real-time routing and traffic data.
Weather API: For predictive weather analysis.
AWS and Google Cloud: For data storage and processing.
GPS Devices: For real-time tracking.

Even though we haven't enabled these APIs, we nonetheless generated a dataset and used faker to accomplish it.

# Benefits

Implementing this logistics optimization system provides several key benefits:

Reduced Fuel Consumption: Through optimized routing.

Lower Operational Costs: By improving workforce management and inventory control.

Enhanced Delivery Reliability: Ensuring predictable and consistent deliveries.

Improved Customer Satisfaction: Through reliable inventory availability and efficient scheduling.

Environmental Impact Reduction: By lowering emissions through optimized routes.

# How to Clone and Set Up the Repository

# To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash-2405/Optimizing-Logistics-and-Transportation.git
cd Optimizing-Logistics-and-Transportation
```

2. Set Up the Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set it up with the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Project

You can now run the Jupyter notebook or any Python scripts included in the repository:

```bash
jupyter notebook Hackathon.ipynb
```

## Conclusion

The proposed system significantly enhances the efficiency of logistics operations, making it a valuable tool for companies looking to optimize their delivery processes, manage inventory better, and improve overall productivity.
